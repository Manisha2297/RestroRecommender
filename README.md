# RestroRecommender

In this project we are building a recommender system that helps you choose the perfect restaurant based on your preference of cuisine/service.

We have initially calculated the cosine similarity between the restaurants based on the services and the cuisines that the restaurant offers. 

Weâ€™ve further built a neural network model that can predict the rating that the user is likely to give to a restaurant by making use of both business data as well as user review data.  

**Steps to run the notebook**

1) Please add the shortcut of this [drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TSbWcosRdVcBU6MUMAYKlQmiETWlQFTo?usp=sharing) on your drive before running the code .

2) Somo of the cells take hours together to run, so to avoid that we've already done the processing and stored the relevant pickle files. Kindly load those files wherever required. This is also being added as a warning in our final notebook.
